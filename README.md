Screen Time insights using python

Screen Time Analysis lets you know how much time you spend on what kind of applications you use on your device. It is the task of analyzing and creating a report on which applications and websites are used by the user for how much time.

Here the provided dataset contains data about:
Date, 
Usage of Applications,
Number of Notifications from Applications, 
Number of times apps opened.

# Project Components

**Data Source :** CSV file

**Notebook :** Google colab

**Data Visualization :** Plotly,Seaborn

# Key Findings

**WhatsApp Dominance:** Through comprehensive analysis, it was determined that WhatsApp consistently emerges as the most utilized app.

**Notification-App Interaction:** A direct correlation was identified between the number of notifications received and subsequent user actions

**WhatsApp's Notification Influence:** Notably, heightened notification activity from WhatsApp corresponds with an observable rise in both the time spent on the app and the frequency of usage.

# Conclusion

In this ScreenTimeInsights project, we explored how people spend time on their devices by analyzing data with Python in Google Colab. By using a CSV file and visualizing data with Plotly and Seaborn, we made some interesting discoveries. WhatsApp stood out as the most used app consistently, showing its dominance in user activity. We also found that when WhatsApp sends more notifications, people not only open the app more often but also spend more time using it. This connection between notifications and user actions highlights the impact of these alerts on our screen time habits. The project provides valuable insights into our digital behavior, helping us understand which apps influence our screen time the most.
